# Tailwind CSS Not Picking Up Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS: styles not being picked up from components.  The problem often stems from incorrect configuration of the `content` option, which tells Tailwind which files to scan for class names.  This example highlights the issue and provides a solution.

## Bug
The original `tailwind.config.js` file (bug.js) has an incorrectly specified `content` path, leading Tailwind to miss the necessary class names.

## Solution
The corrected `tailwind.config.js` file (bugSolution.js) shows how to correctly specify the `content` path, ensuring Tailwind processes all relevant styles.

This repository is meant to help developers understand and resolve common Tailwind CSS configuration issues.  Feel free to use this as a starting point to troubleshoot your own projects.
